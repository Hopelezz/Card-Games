## About The Project

  I was working through the projects in a book called The Big Book of Small Python Projects. Landed on a bit of code called Blackjack. To challenge myself, decided to alter the code to break out things that could be reusable between different games. Talking with my son we came up with a game called War using similar concepts. To prove the game before even starting my girlfriend and I sat down and played a few rounds with an actual deck. We came to realize that based on the amount of your bets towards the end you could be close to wiping out your account. So we decided might be best to add a bonus payout.  

### Lessons Learned:

  With War_Main.py I kept running into an issue where the Deck wasn't generating the Cards. This was a good leason on iterative loops. Found out that my "getDeck()" function wasn't outputting to proper values. To solve this I had to breakdown the loop

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Optimizations:
- [x] Added a Deck Module to use between different games.
- [x] Added Score Win/Lose ratio
- [x] Added rounds, when rounds hit 26 (Half of a deck) Based on the W/L ratio it'll award you a bonus payout.

Features:
- [ ] Selection menu where the user can call up which game they'd wish to play.
- [ ] Player profile that collects game stats.
- [ ] Adding new games like Go Fish, Old Maid (Need to learn this game first), Poker 5-Card Draw, ect.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Hopelezz/Card-Games/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
